# Welcome to Seattle Music Artist Foundary

We're committed to building web infrastructure for the Seattle music scene. Our goal is simple: provide the technical foundation that Seattle musicians need to thrive in today's digital landscape. To create lasting web spaces for community members to reference and put things - not distacted by a megacorp's aglorithm. 

## Why We Started This Project

In one of [Hannah Duckworth](https://www.listentohannah.com/)'s many Instagram based calls to action for the April 22nd [Plugged In event](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1IjINNwET6dIDq6ueJc1Bm?si=c02311110e8545d2) at [Barboza](https://www.thebarboza.com/), she correctly called out that the Seattle music scene has a ton of talent, but doesn't have the same industry infrastructure as cities like LA and Nashville. 

If we want our talented musicians to thrive where they live, right here in Seattle, it's time to start building. 

We're focusing on creating accessible web tools that meet the specific needs of Seattle's music community. But to do this right, we need to hear from you.

## We Need Your Input

We're in the early stages of building this platform, and your feedback is crucial. What web tools would make the biggest difference for you as a Seattle musician?

**[Take our survey](/survey)** to help us understand exactly what you need. Your responses will directly shape what we build and prioritize.

## Our Commitment

We're not making grand promises about revolutionizing the industry overnight. Instead, we're committed to:

- Building practical web tools based on real musician needs
- Creating resources that are accessible to artists at all career stages
- Contributing to Seattle's music infrastructure in a meaningful way
- Being part of the solution to strengthen our local music ecosystem

## Join Us

This is just the beginning of our journey. By filling out the [survey](/survey), you're helping us lay the foundation for something that can truly benefit Seattle's music community.

We believe in Seattle's musicians, and we're excited to build something that serves you
