# A Plan for Something New: SMS for Real Fan Engagement

*This post is inspired by an email conversation with a piloting musician [Sarey Savy](https://www.sareymusic.com/). Go follow them on all platforms (more links at the bottom of the page). *

I’ve been thinking a lot about how artists actually connect with their fans — and where all the current tools fall short. Email lists get ignored. Socials are noisy. DMs are chaotic. There’s no clean way for artists to *see* which fans are really showing up.

So here’s my plan:
A lightweight SMS-based platform for real fan engagement — not mass-blasting updates, but *listening* to fans as they take action and letting that shape how you connect with them.

This doesn’t fully exist yet. I’m building it. And I’m looking for a few artists — maybe you — to help pilot it and shape what it becomes.

## The Concept

You get a dedicated phone number. You give that number to your fans — post it, text it, mention it on stage. Then you prompt them:

> “Bought a ticket to my show? Text me a screenshot.”
> “Voted for me in the radio contest? Send proof and get 100 points.”
> “Posted about my new song? Show me!”

The system tracks these moments of fan action and gives you a dashboard of *who’s actually showing up*. Not just liking posts — doing things that matter.

---

## Why SMS?

Because it’s direct, personal, and lightweight. No apps to install. No new logins to remember. Fans already know how to text.

This isn’t meant to be a broadcast tool like email or Instagram. This is a *reverse broadcast* — a way for fans to reach *you*, show you they’re part of it, and get acknowledged or rewarded for it.

---

## The Goal

I want to help artists identify their **strong nodes** — the 10% of fans who drive the most engagement and influence.

Inspired by *The Tipping Point*, the platform will eventually surface those people for you. Then you can spend your time and energy on the folks who actually amplify your work — and find creative ways to reward them.

Imagine this becoming more like:

> “Be one of my top supporters and unlock exclusive stuff.”
> Instead of:
> “Pay me $5/month for general access.”

## How We’ll Build It

I’m starting small — just SMS. I’ll build a custom number for each artist, using Twilio on the backend. My code will monitor incoming texts, log activity, assign points, and match messages to your fanbase.

You’ll eventually get a dashboard:

- Send and schedule texts
- Segment fans by engagement
- See who’s earned what
- Track growth over time

But we’ll build it together. If you’re one of the first few pilot artists, you’ll help shape what gets built first and how it works.

---

## Pricing Plan

Right now? Free for pilot artists. I want to prove it works first.

Long term, it’ll probably be a freemium model — maybe the first 25 fans are free, and then a low monthly subscription after that. Discounts for yearly billing. Nothing wild. Just sustainable.

---

## Privacy, Spam, Fraud

- No one sees real phone numbers — ever.
- You’ll always have one official number.
- Fans can verify it publicly if needed.
- If spam becomes a thing, I’ll handle it. Not your problem.

## Who’s Building This?

Just me. I’m a professional software engineer pivoting into something I care deeply about: music, community, and building tools that actually help people. I’ve got a solid dev network if I need it, but I’m keeping it lean and focused.

---

If this plan resonates with you, and you’d like to help shape it, I’d love to chat. I’m looking for a few thoughtful artists who are down to experiment, co-create, and explore what fan engagement *could* look like.

Let me know.
