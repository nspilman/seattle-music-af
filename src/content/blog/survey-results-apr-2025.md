## Survey Results Are In: What Musicians Want Most in 2025

As we prepare to launch, we're gathering data to help determine the direction of our platform for the Seattle music community. To that end, we recently launched a survey to better understand which features matter most to artists, bands, and industry professionals. With 13 thoughtful responses so far, some early patterns are starting to emerge.

### The Top Contenders: Fan Engagement Takes the Lead

At the top of the list, **Fan Engagement Tools** are the clear favorite, with an average rating of **4.15** out of 5. Musicians are eager for new ways to connect with their audiences, and this demand is coming through loud and clear.

Close behind, the **Electronic Press Kit** (EPK) stands strong at **3.92**. EPKs remain essential for artists seeking gigs, press, and collaboration opportunities, so it’s no surprise they’re a high priority.

### Marketing & Analytics: The Backbone of Growth

**Marketing Automation** (3.85) and the **Analytics Dashboard** (3.62) are also highly valued. Musicians want to reach new fans and understand what’s working, making these tools critical for growth and strategy.

### The Essentials: Websites, Booking, and Merch

**Artist Websites** and **Booking Systems** (both at 3.31) are solidly in the middle, with **Merch Stores** (3.23) close behind. These are foundational features for any artist, but the scores suggest they’re seen as necessities rather than differentiators.

### Room for Growth: Services Directory

The **Services Directory** received an average rating of **3.15**. While still appreciated, it appears to be a lower priority compared to direct fan and business tools.

## What’s Next?

These early results are helping us focus our roadmap, but we’re just getting started. We’re aiming for at least 30 responses to get a stronger signal from the community. If you haven’t participated yet, your feedback could make all the difference in shaping the future of our platform.

Stay tuned as more voices come in and the picture becomes even clearer.
