## SMS‑Based Fan Engagement Gamification

Our latest survey surfaced three clear needs: **Fan Engagement, Marketing Automation, and Analytics**. An SMS‑driven points system can cover all three without forcing fans to install yet another app. This is a **feedback‑only draft**—no development has started.

### How It Could Work

* **Engagement Texts** — Fans opt in by texting a keyword to your dedicated number. They receive concise tasks such as "Stream the new single," "Share the flyer," or "Bring a friend to the next show." The fan then texts back when they've completed the task. 
* **Points & Tiers** — Tasks award points (50 pts for a stream, 75 pts for a share, 150 pts for a confirmed ticket buy). Tiers unlock at 500 pts (**Local Hero**) and 1,000 pts (**VIP**).
* **Automation Layer** — The platform schedules and sends each task at the right moment—release day, tour announcement, or recap—so you're not juggling manual DMs.
* **Analytics Dashboard** — Every link is tracked. You see clicks, completions, and which fans are most engaged.

### Why SMS?

* **98% open rate** and near‑instant reads.
* Zero install friction; any phone with texting works.
* Easier spinup cost on the developer side.

### Sample Tasks & Point Values

| Task                      | Points |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Stream on release day     | 50     |
| Repost show flyer         | 75     |
| Buy a ticket              | 150    |
| Bring a friend to the gig | 200    |

Artists would start with a set of tasks and points, then they could adjust as needed. The platform would handle the scheduling and sending of texts. In addition, artists could set one time tasks for specific events - such as new release presave campaigns, anything that requires voting by a specific deadline, etc.

### Rewards by Tier

These are examples. Each artist will choose rewards that fit their audience.

| Tier       | Points Range | Example Rewards                                |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Rookie     | 0–499       | Early access to new single                     |
| Local Hero | 500–999     | Guest‑list spot raffle                        |
| VIP        | 1,000+       | Backstage meet‑and‑greet or signed set‑list |

### Compliance Basics

Fans see clear opt‑in language ("4 msgs/month, reply STOP to quit"). Opt‑out is automatic. All activity is logged for record‑keeping.
