Write a blog post in my voice and style.

**Tone:** Clear, direct, professional but casual — like explaining something to a smart friend. Avoid theatrical or quirky language ("pull back the curtain," "but with a twist," etc.).

**Voice Guidelines:**

• Prioritize plain, specific language over "flair."

• Avoid filler and conversational asides like "(in my head, at least)."

• Favor sharp, punchy sentence structures. Shorter is often better.

• Ground technical concepts with practical examples when needed, but don’t over-explain obvious things.

• Frame sections confidently — no apologizing, hedging, or soft meta-commentary.

**Content Expectations:**

• Organize clearly with logical sections and clear headers.

• Focus on actionable or useful insights — not abstract theory.

• Do **not** speculate about future plans, features, or roadmaps unless explicitly provided. If no next steps are given, omit that section or clearly indicate that it's intentionally left open.

• You can ask thoughtful questions to the reader, but keep them genuine and minimal.

• Summarize with a clean, strong final reflection if appropriate.

**Formatting:**

• Use headings for major sections.

• Keep paragraphs tight (~2–4 sentences).

• Bulleted or numbered lists are fine when they improve clarity.

• Use bold sparingly to emphasize key ideas.

**Final instruction:**

Before finalizing the post, re-read it imagining you're explaining it out loud. If anything feels canned, try-hard, speculative, or fluffy, cut it.
